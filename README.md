# findthem_proy

## (ENG)
Recently I've been taking a web design and development course for beginners. Although I have some *basic knowledge*, I have put some effort into this project to the point of taking some love for it.

### About the project.
*findthem_proy* is a studio project done by Erikdediosd (Charcoal). 
#### Technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- PHP

**Find Them** is a real server, which aims to become a community that provides the means for those interested in this world of programming to find workgroups in which to work, practice and develop their skills as programmers.
This includes, of course, the handling of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in the case of web development; and, although so far only those 3 languages are handled, there are plans to reach more. Much more.
Without anything else to add, I leave my project here, something quite simple to recreate. See ya' boi'.
